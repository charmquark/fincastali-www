List
    name            string                              (list name; mainly for admin site)
    description     string                              (brief description of the category for use as a reminder in admin site; not what appears on page)
    tag             string          unique              (used internally for marrying a list to its page) (use plain record id instead? secure? practical?)

    has-many        ListCategory    as :categories


ListCategory
    name            string                              (category name; what appears in the page menu)
    description     string                              (brief description of the category for use as a reminder in admin site) (add these to the actual list page as well?)

    belongs-to      List            as :list
    has-many        Listing         as :listings


Listing                                                 (a listing simply joins an entity to a category)
    belongs-to      ListCategory    as :category
    belongs-to      ListEntity      as :entity


ListEntity
    name            string                              (name of entity; eg, 'Beloved Viking Vinyl' or 'Bob Smith')
    description     string                              (short description; appears on page, in listing card)
    accepts_custom  boolean                             (whether the entity accepts custom orders)
    image           string                              (decorative image to be used behind listings on page) (rather than string, store image directly in db?)
    urls            string                              (web address(es) of shopfront or whatever) (serialized array? yml? delimited?)

    has-many        Listing         as: listings        (one entity may have multiple listings)



BRAINSTORM:

 * possibly associate images to listings, rather than entities?  then one entity might have a different
    decorative image on their card, depending on which category is being viewed.  could curate images
    to be category-relavent.

 * admin site should present a (semi-)live preview of listing cards

 * allow markup in descriptions? (<em></em> for example) is this really needed?
